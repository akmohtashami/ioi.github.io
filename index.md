This site contains a collection of tools and documentation which are used
by the organizers of the [International Olympiad in Informatics](https://www.ioinformatics.org/).
It lives in the [IOI organization](https://github.com/ioi/) at GitHub.
It supersedes the technical part of the IOI Wiki.

The main document maintained here is the [IOI Technical Checklist](checklist/).
